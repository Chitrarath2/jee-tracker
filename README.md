## Data Structure üíæ

Your progress is stored in `jee_progress.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "subjects": {
    "Physics": {
      "Mechanics": {
        "Kinematics": {
          "status": "completed",
          "confidence": 8,
          "last_studied": "2025-05-31T10:30:00",
          "time_spent": 5.5,
          "notes": "Covered all basic concepts",
          "problems_solved": 25
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "daily_logs": {},
  "study_hours": {},
  "test_scores": []
}
```

## Advanced Usage üîß

### Using as Python Module

```python
from jee_tracker import JEEProgressTracker

# Create tracker instance
tracker = JEEProgressTracker()

# Log study session
tracker.log_daily_study("Physics", 2.5, ["Kinematics", "Laws of Motion"])

# Update topic progress
tracker.update_topic_progress("Mathematics", "Algebra", "Quadratic Equations", 
                             status="completed", confidence=8, time_spent=3.0)

# Add test score
tracker.add_test_score("JEE Main Mock Test 1", "Physics", 85, 100)

# Get subject progress
progress = tracker.get_subject_progress("Physics")
print(f"Physics completion: {progress['completion_rate']:.1f}%")

# Generate study plan
plan = tracker.generate_study_plan(days_until_exam=90)
```

## Tips for Effective Usage üí°

1. **Daily Logging**: Log your study sessions daily for accurate time tracking
2. **Honest Assessment**: Rate your confidence honestly (1-10 scale)
3. **Regular Updates**: Update topic status as you progress
4. **Use Notes**: Add notes for important concepts or difficulties
5. **Review Dashboard**: Check dashboard weekly to identify weak areas

## Status Definitions üìä

- **not_started**: Haven't begun studying this topic
- **in_progress**: Currently learning/reviewing this topic  
- **completed**: Finished studying, comfortable with basics
- **revision**: Ready for final revision before exam

## Confidence Scale üéØ
